Saw this beaut today when installing the latest version of Java.

![Yahoo now replaces Ask.com as the default adware for Java](http://sohailmamdani.github.com/img/oh-oracle.png)

Looks like Yahoo! has replaced Ask.com as the default adware for Java installs. 

This is not what we meant when we asked you to get rid of Ask.com, Oracle. 

Yeesh.
