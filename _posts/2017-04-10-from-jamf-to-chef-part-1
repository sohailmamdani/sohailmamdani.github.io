I've spent the last five years honing my skills as a Jamf admin. I started at eBay, working for one of the best bosses I've ever had (ohai Alex Dale). Since then, I've gotten my CCA and CCE and have had the pleasure of working for a number of companies where I've either implemented or improved on the Jamf framework, imaging workflow, and a whole lot more.

I'm currently working at GoPro as the Senior Client Engineer for the Mac fleet and I'm spearheading our conversion from  Jamf to Chef. It is _easily_ the most challenging thing I've ever done, not least because it is nothing like Jamf, but because you actually have to undergo a mindset change.

Here then, is a somewhat rambling, somewhat contextualized look at my process for moving from the safe, comfortable world of Jamf and into the frontier that is Chef Open Source.
