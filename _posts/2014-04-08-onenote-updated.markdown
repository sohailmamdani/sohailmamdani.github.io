While working on the new [iPad Baby Pro](http://lowlyadmin.com/apple/2016/03/31/babypro-bigpro/) a few days ago, I came across this one issue with [OneNote](http://onenote.com) that kept it from working as well on the Baby Pro. 

So, being the entitled brat I can sometimes be, I took to twitter to , uh, "demand" that Microsoft answer for itself.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">. <a href="https://twitter.com/msonenote">@msonenote</a> any idea when you‚Äôll have an update to OneNote iOS so palm rejection works better on new iPad Pro 9.7‚Ä≥? <a href="https://t.co/FvITnr9JsQ">https://t.co/FvITnr9JsQ</a></p>&mdash; Sohail Mamdani (@sohail) <a href="https://twitter.com/sohail/status/715934974906654724">April 1, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I got the rote answer from them.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/sohail">@sohail</a> We do not have an update at this time. Follow our blog for the latest news and release information: <a href="https://t.co/8jtKQ55XYS">https://t.co/8jtKQ55XYS</a>.</p>&mdash; Microsoft OneNote (@msonenote) <a href="https://twitter.com/msonenote/status/715976526592868352">April 1, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I guess I didn't expect much more than that, but then I got a nice surprice. Ryan McMinn, who works on the OneNote team, pinged me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/sohail">@sohail</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/msonenote">@msonenote</a> just read the blog, we will take a look and see what&#39;s going on with the baby iPad Pro and Apple Pencil.</p>&mdash; Ryan McMinn (@ryanmcminn) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanmcminn/status/716341856548691968">April 2, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We exchanged a few DMs and sure enough, there was a shiny new update for OneNote later in the week. Now, writing in OneNote with Apple Pencil works beautifully.

OneNote has become my go-to notes app, not least because I can now actually write in it. Add to that the fact that sync works across all my platforms (and I can even use the web app in Linux if I need it) and there are clippers for Safari/Firefox and I have an app that's getting ever closer to Evernote in functionality, but in an interface that's cleaner than Evernote has become. I find that I don't miss tags as much as I thought I did and the tabs/pages metaphor in OneNote is pretty effective for me, since it mimic the various notebooks I found myself writing in before I owned an iPad Baby Pro. 

Of course, OneNote isn't without faults. One glaring one is the inability to sort pages alphabetically or by date. So, of course, when I got on Twitter to send my thanks to Ryan McMinn and OneNote for the update for the Baby Pro, my entitled side came out in the form of a compliment-plus-"what have you done for me lately" tweet. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yass! <a href="https://twitter.com/msonenote">@msonenote</a> updated for 9.7‚Äù Pro! Works perfectly, no palm marks, thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanmcminn">@ryanmcminn</a>! Now, about that sort by date feature for pages‚Ä¶ üòâ</p>&mdash; Sohail Mamdani (@sohail) <a href="https://twitter.com/sohail/status/718862632841715712">April 9, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Ryan's a class act. He immediately tweeted back.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/sohail">@sohail</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/msonenote">@msonenote</a> that&#39;s on the list already ;)</p>&mdash; Ryan McMinn (@ryanmcminn) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanmcminn/status/718865132370046976">April 9, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Well hot damn.
