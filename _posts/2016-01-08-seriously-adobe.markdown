Mac Sysadmins know [this site really well](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/distribution3.html). We go to it to get the blessedly simple .pkg to push out new versions of Flash Player, because the default installer from Adobe's site is a crappy .app or some other custom installer that simply goes "What's Enterprise?"

Which is why I was so pissed to see this:

I went through the process of applying for a license to distribute Flash, but it was pretty apparent that Adobe hasn't even considered that IT Sysadmins would want to have access to the .pkg because the survey questions are all geared towards app developers.

Adobe, freaking kill Flash already. It's an absolute pain the rear end.
