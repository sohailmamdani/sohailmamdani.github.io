Okay, this is something I've known about for a while, but lately I've done this often enough to where it's a super-irritant. 

I wanted to send someone a link for [1Password for Teams](https://teams.1password.com) recently. Couldn't remember the subdomain so I Googled it. 

What I wanted was the first result. Under the hyperlink for the result was the URL `https://teams.1password.com`. I right-clicked on the hyperlink and selected "Copy Link."

Went to an email window and pasted it. This was the unholy mess I got:

```
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjsjPW20aXKAhUDLmMKHdfODuAQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.1password.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNE4sORg0eacmWu8aS4PDEO2vnMOFw
```

Okay, look. I know that Google redirects your clicks through their analytics servers. I get it. But damnit, it's terrible design. I do NOT want to see the entire Google search redirect URL when `https://teams.1password.com` is what I'm looking for. 

Damnit Google.
