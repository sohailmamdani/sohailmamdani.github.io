> On Friday (Nov. 20), NASA awarded a work order to Elon Musk’s private space firm, SpaceX, to transport astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). Boeing received a similar order for a manned flight back in May. The missions will take place on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecrafts.
