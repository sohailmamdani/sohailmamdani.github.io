I have a secret identity. When I'm not plonking away at my keyboard, working on sysadmin-y stuff, I like to work on more fanciful projects. I write, I [shoot photos][1], and of late, I'm tiptoeing [into video][2]. 

As part of that, I'm working on a new narrative short and thought I'd try working on that on my new [iPad Pro][3]. Now, I have the industry standard [Final Draft][4] installed on my Mac, PC, iPad, and iOS devices. Problem is, it uses Dropbox for syncing scripts, which I don't use. 

Instead, I broke out my trust text editor on the iPad and created a file with a .fountain suffix. Fountain, for those who don't know, is [a markup language specifically for writing scripts and screenplays][5]. You write your script in a plain text editor marked up with Fountain syntax and then use an app like the awesome [Marked 2][6] to convert it into a formatted script or screenplay. 

I didn't expect Textastic to recognize the Fountain markup, but to my surprise, it totally did!

With Textastic open in the main window and the [Fountain Reference Guide][7] pulled up in [GoodReader][8] in the side window, I'm able to type everything up in Fountain and then output it to a finished script later. 
Score one more for iPad productivity.
